# Analyses of gene set enrichment in schizophrenia-associated common and (ultra)-rare variants
Code and data (where possible) for gene set enrichment analyses in scz-associated common and (ultra-)rare variants for paper: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.26.21257794v2  
Analyses of exome sequenced data including QC were performed using Hail 0.2 (Hail Team. Hail 0.2.62-84fa81b9ea3d. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/commit/84fa81b9ea3d). QC generally followed those described here: https://astheeggeggs.github.io/BipEx/index.html and here: https://github.com/andgan/ultra_rare_pheno_spectrum
